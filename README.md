# ðŸš© Minecraft Banner Renderer

With this library you can render minecraft banners on a 2d canvas by providing the different patterns in a array.
The BannerPatternType and dyecolor enum is identical to the one in bukkit. You might need to convert them if you want to display vanilla banners.

## Atlas

To use this renderer you need to create a atlas image. Simply run the kotlin project in the atlas-generator folder to generate one. The images will 
be automatically downloaded and extracted from the official minecraft client.
